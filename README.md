# DSS-schedule-opt üóìÔ∏è
A university project focused on finding the optimal schedule for a university bachelor program given a set of constraints.

## Heuristics involved
### Heuristic to build the first solution
Pretty simple, we just try to allocate the slots for the most demanding teachers first, and then we continue assining for the others.
### How to move the slots
Our schedule is worse if it contains holes between lessons or if teachers' preferences are not met. Hence, for each iteration, we keep two lists of slots. These represent the best slots to move/swap depending on some criteria. 
 - For moving to an empty slot: we move a slot only if it does not create a hole after moving (so the first or last slot of a day).
 - For swapping: we prefer to swap the slots that are not at the start of end (middle) because we cannot move them.
Then we do a Variable Neighbourhood Search trying to improve the solution using slots of the same day. If it does not improve we try to do the move using other days as well.

## Teachers input examples
To test the system 7 examples have been created in incresing difficulty (each slot is min 2 hours long). Each example contains underised and unavailable time slots expressed by each fictional teacher.
### Dummy
Each teacher has two undesired and two unavailable slots. The slots are simple 2‚Äëhour blocks with a light spread across the week.
### Easy
The slots are spread a bit differently by day and some blocks for first‚Äëyear teachers fall in the early morning while later courses are reserved for the upper years.
### Medium
Each teacher lists three undesired and three unavailable slots. Now morning/early‚Äêday slots are favored for first‚Äëyear instructors and later hours for those teaching advanced courses.
### Difficult
In this scenario each teacher has three slots per list and some of the entries are four‚Äëhour blocks. The assignments now show more variety in day and time so that the algorithm must handle longer, overlapping blocks.
### Very Difficult
In this final example every teacher lists four undesired and four unavailable slots. Several of these blocks span four hours, and the distribution is intentionally heavy and overlapping to stress-test the scheduling algorithm.
### Unreal
Every teacher now has five undesired and five unavailable time slots, with some slots spanning four hours and others overlapping or covering large portions of a day.
### Hell
In this configuration every teacher now has six undesired and six unavailable slots, with many slots spanning four hours and overlapping in various ways. This example is deliberately overconstrained‚Äîwith alternating days and blocks that force the algorithm to choose between multiple conflicting options.
